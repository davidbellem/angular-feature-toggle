angular-feature-toggle
======================

Feature Toggle Pattern for angular. This is inspired by https://github.com/mjt01/angular-feature-flags.

Main Idea
---------
Provide possibility to toggle out certain features or elements based on a config file.

Implementation
--------------
The directive pw-feature-toggle can be used on any DOM element to make it disappear.

Individual features can be enabled by setting them to enabled in the data/features.json file.

Scaffolding was done using yeoman.




Enjoy.
